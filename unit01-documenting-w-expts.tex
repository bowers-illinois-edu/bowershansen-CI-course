\section{Overview}

\begin{frame}[label=CIFr]{``Causal Inference''}

 \textit{Causal inference} is about design and analysis of experiments
 and observational studies so as to create fair comparisons that
 enable you to measure effects of interventions.


\end{frame}

% old (2015-) version of above frame:
% \begin{frame}[label=CIFr]{``Causal inference'' again}

% `Causal inference'' is about design and analysis of randomized and
% nonrandomized studies with goals:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Meaningful comparisons, ie comparisons that reveal causation (if present) simply and w/ minimal overhead;
% \item On scrutiny, EITHER indicated causation occurred OR \ldots
% \end{enumerate}


% (where a short, circumscribed list follows the ``OR'')

% \end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label=whatWeWillCoverFr]{Methods we'll study in the course}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Randomization-based analysis for experiments
  \item Natural experiments, quasi-experiments,
    difference-in-differences
  \item Effect estimation \& inference in the presence of interference
  \item Propensity scores, propensity score matching
%  \item Regression discontinuity
  \item Omitted variable sensitivity analysis
  \item Instrumental variables \& principal stratification
  \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\Note{Don't linger, I come back to this slide after Causal Inference
  in Experiments section}

\begin{frame}{Three traditions in quantitative analysis}
\framesubtitle{A brief, tendentious review}

Modern causal inference in the 19th c., emerges over the 20th c, hits
it stride during this century. Dominant strains of quantitative
analysis in social science, by century:

\begin{itemize}
\item[19th] social physics
\item[20th] sampling of populations
\item[21st] causal inference (a prediction)
\end{itemize}

  
\end{frame}

\section{Causal inference in simple experiments}

\begin{frame}{Centrality of experiment to modern CI}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experiments are conceptually and practically central
  \item Not just any experiments, particular types, featuring
    \textit{control groups} and \textit{random assignment}\footnote{In
    this regard statisticians' concept of ``experiment'' is slightly
    idiosyncratic.  Compare Kinder \& Palfrey's (1993) definition to that of
    Rosenbaum (2010, ch 2.)}
  \item Central characteristics of an ideal situation
  \item The ideal reveals its merits in a variety of disciplines over
    the 20th c.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

blackboard I walked them through strict null for the Salk trial,
tested it approximately using N-approx, $\mathrm{sd}_{0}(\hat p)
\approx \sqrt{p_{0}q_{0}/n_{1}}$.  This seemed to work well.

    \mu_{c}$; $\mu_{t}(x), \mu_{c}(x)$.
  \item Counterfactual conditional.

  \item Unit-level potential outcomes (Rubin, 1970s): $y_{t}, y_{c}$.

\subsection{Conceptual framework}
\begin{frame}{Goals of experimental design}

Experiment design aims to create a situation in which causation is
readily detected. If the putative causes
really do have their intended effects, you'll tend to see it; if they
don't, you'll tend not to.
\pause

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \textrm{Random
    assignment}  sure helps. Units 1-3 theorize this point along lines
  of Fisher, Neyman and their current-day followers.
\item In comparative assessments of study designs, random assignment also benefits
  from its association with other design characteristics of
  high-quality studies:  distinctions among covariates, treatments and
  outcomes; comparability of treatment and control groups; \ldots;
  formal study planning (Rosenbaum, \textit{DOS}, ch. 1.)
\end{itemize}

\item Explain differences
\item both versions are experiments in the everyday sense
\item both control for age and physical locale
\item large size, presence of these controls lends legitimacy to both
\item In this case I maintain that markers of good design are an
  illusion, it's an overtly unfair comparison.  Why isn't this
  apples-to-apples?
\item Exercises: abstract $2\times 2$ table. \textrm{Think-pair-share}
\item Demonstration of advantage of random assigment per se
\item We'll see how to get the ``right answer'', despite shortcomings.  The move is
  primarily conceptual, not technical, having to do w/ IVs.

\section*{Closing remarks}

%\againframe{CIFr}
 
\begin{frame}{Course prerequisites}
  \begin{enumerate}
\item experience using a command-based computer program (as opposed to a menu-driven one)
\item willingness to try on attitudes suitable to
  non-commercial software: expect to err; trust but validate.
\item willingness to learn R  (if it's new to you, consider taking the course)
\item willingness to learn markdown (you can do this on your own)
\item Conditional probability and conditional expectation: prior
  exposure, or openness to self-study
  \item mathematical proofs, enough to distinguish correct from incorrect


  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
