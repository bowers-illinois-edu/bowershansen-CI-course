Dear Dr.Bowers, 

My name is Chuyu Liu, and I am a student in your CI course. 

The class on "Non-bipartite matching" is amazing. I really like the class. 

I was wondering whether we could spend a little bit more time talking about the basic principle of "Non-bipartite matching" and how to do it in R. 

I guess most of students may not be that fimilar with the R package "nbpMatching". More importantly, it is indeed challenging for many of us to fully understand the relevant literature such as Lu et al. (2011). So, a brief lecture on the basic intuition underlying "Non-bipartite matching" would be very appreciated. 

Many thanks!

Bests,

Chuyu Liu
