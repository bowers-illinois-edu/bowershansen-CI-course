## Unit 1, Documenting causation

### To build on or extend from prior courses

N/A, but course prereqs:

- formal logic, enough to identify valid/not valid math proofs/deductive arguments
-  Conditional probability and conditional expectation (you can fill this in, but it'll take additional self-study)
- experience using a command-based computer program (as opposed to a menu-driven one)
- willingness to learn R  (if it's new to you, consider taking the course)
- willingness to learn markdown (you can do this on your own)


### To be introduced in this unit
#### examples


- Salk vaccine trials
- Coffee tasting/Fisher tea-tasting
- Fri the 13th

#### assumptions

- Assignment of units of study to treatment conditions is (considered to be) performed by simple randomization or paired randomization

#### techniques

- permutation-based p-values
     - what are they?
     - basic examples
     - what they do & don't assume
- reading and re-running R code from a script


#### technical concepts

- Random assignment
- Hypothesis of absolutely no effect
 - timeline of comparative studies & associated distinctions (covariates vs "baseline" vs outcomes variables)
 - rerandomization test of a strict null hypothesis
 

#### broader concepts

- Causal relativity: Statistical arguments for causation call for comparison.  Whether the comparison of two groups is legitimate is **not** essentially a function of how similar the two groups are; rather it's contextual:
  - random assignment certainly sets the stage (there may be other ways)
  - proper calibration of how large a difference has to be to be "real" vs "chance"
  - one does need a "large sample" -- but check your intuition about "large".



 
### If it fits in....

- Three trends in quantitative analysis
    - social physics (19th c)
    - sampling of populations (20th c)
    - modern causal inference (   )
- A modern causal perspective may change your views on:
    - "the race effect was..."
    - "the intervention effect was..."
    - omitted variable bias
    - generalizing from sample to population
    - non-compliance (with a designated intervention)
    - non-independence of outcomes (we'll develop some new concepts for thinking about this)
    - what quantitative analysis does and doesn't need theory for
    - what theory does and doesn't need quantitative analysis for
    
## Unit 2
### To build on/extend from prior units

salk trial NFIP study (CACE estimation)

expected value/$\mu$ vs $\mu_{t}/\mu_{c}$

random assignment

baseline vs tx assmt vs outcome distinction

### To be introduced in this unit

#### examples

- village councilwomen in India
- hospitalizations on fri 13th
- acorn

#### assumptions
- complete random assignment
- no spillovers between units
- exclusion (where appropriate, near end of unit when non-compliance introduced)

#### techniques
- Expected values, variances for means under a strong null
- Unpooled SE for difference of means
- Aggregate by cluster
- calculate expected values from a response schedule
- ~~calculate variances from a response schedule~~

### technical concepts
- structural characteristics of experiments & random assignment:
    - common properties of randomized designs: complete, simple, balanced
    - paired comparisons
    - clusters vs elements
 -   potential outcomes schedules
 - SE as a generic estimate for SD_0
 - Conditional probability
      -  conditioning on Z'Z
      - conditioning on Z=1 or Z=0
- Non-compliance
    - ITT analysis
    - Exclusion/exclusivity
- With clusters, relevant "sample size" is the number of clusters, not the number of elements.

  
#### broader concepts

 - ITT vs per-protocol
 -   If there are clusters, proper SEs will have to attend carefully to them. Either aggregate data, or make sure your formula/computer program is attending to clustering
 -  Unbiased estimation is convenient, but limiting yourself to unbiased estimators may be too constraining
 
### If it fits in

- Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference



## Unit 3, Fisherian randomization inference & models of effects


Basic learning goals
- rerandomization to generate reference distributions, and thus p-values for arbitrary test statistics
- Confidence intervals by inversion
- rerandomization lets you associate p-values with arbitrary test statistics
- "robust" testing and its importance for power
-  p-values from simulation in R

special topics & by-products:
- What the problem of weak instruments is, and why it's so much easier to deal with from the Fisherian perspective
- non-interference is presumed by Y_t/Y_c notation, but not necessarily by an incomplete response schedule
- interference $\neq$ non-independence.  (Lots of non-independence among outcomes can be wrapped up into baseline differences, and doesn't require us to permit presence of interference.)
-  Maybe $ \bar p(1-\bar p)/n$ has a usage after all: error of approximation of p-value simulation).


Statistical assumptions made throughout this unit:

- The assignment of units of study to treatment conditions is
      - random
      - governed by known probabilities of assignment


## Unit 04, baseline comparability and blocking

**shove into here**:
- $\mu$ vs $\mu(x)$ (ie cond'l expectation in general);  $\mu_{t}(x)/\mu_{c}(x)$ (postponed from ch 2)
-  SATEs vs PATEs

- Baseline comparability
  - Randomization tests
	  + Multiplicity issue
	  + Mahal dist-based check of Hansen and Bowers 2008
	  + Unstratified vs pair matched examples
	  + for designs w/ blocks, shuffle w/in strata
  - Stratified and post-stratified experiments and natural experiments

  - NAs in a covariate (reference DOS ch 9)
	    + missingness as data
	    + (MAR vs MCAR)
- Blocking and poststratification
	-  pairs, blocks as a generalization of pairs

- Searching for natural experiments
	- Stepwise intersection-union principle and balance checking

- NOT HERE BUT LATER:
- Methods of combining effect estimates across poststrata:
  - "fixed effects"
  - standardization with a standard population
  - Inverse probability weighting
  - Variant of IPW to target the effect of treatment on treated
