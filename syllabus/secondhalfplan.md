ICPSR 2016 Second Half Plan

# Aug 2 (unit05-Rex.Rnw)
 - Practice with creating matched designs

# Aug 3 (unit08-Rex.Rnw --> unit06-Rex.Rnw)
 - Practicing judgement with matched designs.

# Aug 4
 - Estimation and Uncertainty (Standard Errors, etc…) Follow the Green Lab SOP
 - unbiasedness via simulation
 - coverage by simulation
           - With unequal block sizes we have to choose a weighting scheme: ETT, ATE harmonic, Block size weights (and Winston methods)
          -  What do we gain from Logit for treatment effects?  (nothing really)
Plus perhaps:
 ? - Matched design plus covariates
 ? - Show problems with Logit and covariates
(building on unit09-Rex.Rnw)
 - Add difference in differences.

# Aug 5
 - Estimation and Uncertainty (HC2 SEs…) (unit10Rex-Rnw)
 — And coverage.
 — maybe covariance adjustment.

# Aug 8 i
 - Using xBalance and CMH (in coin allows approximative inference) to test hypotheses about outcomes in matched designs.
 - check coverage by simulations
          -  Stephenson’s ranks and Attrib Effects?
        - Add difference in differences.

# Aug 9
 - Diff in Diffs and RDD

# Aug 10
 - Rosenbaum Style Sensitivity Analysis (unit13-Rex.Rnw)

# Aug 11
 - Sensitive analysis HHH Style (unit14-Rex.Rnw)
 - Nonbipartite matching
