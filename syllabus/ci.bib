	Annote = {AIR embed the instrumental variables framework in the
		  Rubin Causal Model. Under several assumptions, IV estimates
		  are causal estimates for the principal component,
		  compliers. The assumptions can be easily loosened under a
		  Bayesian framework in the RCM. Without these assumptions,
		  the IV estimates are merely the ratio $\frac{ITT_y}{ITT_D}$
		  (not a causal effect). The assumptions: SUTVA, random
		  treatment assignment (Z), exclusion (any effect of Z on Y
		  must be ``via an effect of D on Y'' -- or, there is no
		  causal effect of treatment Z on outcome Y for always- and
		  never-takers), assignment Z has nonzero average effect on
		  D, monotonicity (assignment increases probability of
		  treatment). There is a substantial bias in IV effect
		  estimates if the size of the principal component, defiers,
		  is large. Shift from [E(e,Z)=0] to [exclusion and
		  ignorability].},
