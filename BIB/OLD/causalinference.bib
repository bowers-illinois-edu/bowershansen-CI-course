abstract ={We contribute to debate about causal inferences in educational research in two ways. First, we quantify how much bias there must be in an estimate to invalidate an inference. Second, we utilize Rubin’s causal model to interpret the bias necessary to invalidate an inference in terms of sample replacement. We apply our analysis to an inference of a positive effect of Open Court Curriculum on reading achievement from a randomized experiment, and an inference of a negative effect of kindergarten retention on reading achievement from an observational study. We consider details of our framework, and then discuss how our approach informs judgment of inference relative to study design. We conclude with implications for scientific discourse.},

abstract ={The effect of unreliability of measurement on propensity score (PS) adjusted treatment effects has not been previously studied. The authors report on a study simulating different degrees of unreliability in the multiple covariates that were used to estimate the PS. The simulation uses the same data as two prior studies. Shadish, Clark, and Steiner showed that a PS formed from many covariates demonstrably reduced selection bias, while Steiner, Cook, Shadish, and Clark identified the subsets of covariates from the larger set that were most effective for bias reduction. Adding different degrees of random error to these covariates in a simulation, the authors demonstrate that unreliability of measurement can degrade the ability of PSs to reduce bias. Specifically, increases in reliability only promote bias reduction, if the covariates are effective in reducing bias to begin with. Increasing or decreasing the reliability of covariates that do not effectively reduce selection bias makes no difference at all.},

abstract = "Subjects in clinical trials are frequently randomized within blocks to ensure balance between treatment groups during the accrual period. Often, the block sizes themselves are also randomly selected. If the trial is unblinded and the block size known, the treatment assignment of some subjects will be known before they are randomized. This knowledge could lead to a bias where the investigator selects healthier subjects for a particular treatment. An investigator's potential to bias study depends on two factors: knowledge of the block distribution and the extent to which he uses this knowledge. Both factors are investigated. Knowledge of the block distribution is reflected by the variability of the estimates of the distribution. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and ad hoc estimates are considered. An investigator's willingness to bias is formalized by defining a class of schemes where the decision to bias depends on the probability of correctly guessing a treatment assignment. The amount of bias these different schemes can introduce is quantified. Fixed blocks are easier to estimate and more susceptible to bias than random blocks. In general, the block distribution with least bias depends on the investigator's biasing strategy. However, block distributions with larger block sizes and uniform or increasing weights should work well in most situations. "
