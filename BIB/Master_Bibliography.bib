		  this article investigates the application of synthetic
		  control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the
		  advantages of these methods and apply them to study the
		  effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control
		  program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate
		  that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell
		  markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic
		  control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual
		  per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26
		  packs lower than what they would have been in the absence
		  of Proposition 99. Given that many policy interventions and
		  events of interest in social sciences take place at an
		  aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and
		  affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential
		  applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative
		  case studies is very large, especially in situations where
		  traditional regression methods are not appropriate. The
		  methods proposed in this article produce informative
		  inference regardless of the number of available comparison
		  units, the number of available time periods, and whether
		  the data are individual (micro) or aggregate (macro).
		  Software to compute the estimators proposed in this article
		  is available at the authors' web-pages.},

		  large relative to treated, bias can be ignored (15).

	Abstract = {This article investigates the economic effects of
		  conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the Basque
		  Country as a case study. We find that, after the outbreak
		  of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the
		  Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative
		  to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In
		  addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural
		  experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant
		  part of their business in the Basque Country showed a
		  positive relative performance when truce became credible,
		  and a negative relative performance at the end of the
		  cease-fire.},

	Abstract = { The past two decades have brought revolutionary change to
		  the field of political methodology. Steady gains in
		  theoretical sophistication have combined with explosive
		  increases in computing power to produce a profusion of new
		  estimators for applied political researchers. Attendance at
		  the annual Summer Meeting of the Methodology Section has
		  multiplied many times, and section membership is among the
		  largest in APSA. All these are signs of success. Yet there
		  are warning signs, too. This paper attempts to critically
		  summarize current developments in the young field of
		  political methodology. It focuses on recent generalizations
		  of dichotomous-dependentvariable estimators such as logit
		  and probit, arguing that even our best new work needs a
		  firmer connection to credible models of human behavior and
		  deeper foundations in reliable empirical generalizations.

	Annote = {Choice quotes: Achen 2002 p. 424: Even at the most
		  quantitative end of the profession, much contemporary
		  empirical work has little long-termscientificvalue. Achen
		  2002 p.434: By now, though, a concern should have arisen in
		  the readers mind. For this generality is all too quick.
		  Yes, dozens of estimators are easily created for any
		  situation. Unfortunately, they often fit approximately
		  equally well but give quite different answers.... Purely
		  statistical considerations cannot tell us what to do. Worse
		  yet, generality is not free. These setups with additional
		  parameters often require surprisingly large
		  datasetstobesuccessful.... p.435: It is important to
		  understand that nothing in the previous paragraphs
		  indicates that scobit and power logit have no uses, or that
		  the software used to generate their estimates is
		  misleading. To the contrary, the estimators are genuine
		  advances and the software generally works well on what is a
		  difficult numerical estimation. The point is rather that
		  generalizing logit can be very expensive in statistical
		  precision, a point confirmed by theoretical work on
		  scobit(Taylor1988). p.436: Since each newestimator imposes
		  a certain structure on the data and often uses up
		  additional degrees of freedom to create statistical
		  generality, why should we believe these assumptions in this
		  problem? Typically, no formal model supports the
		  assumptions, and no close data analysis is presented in
		  their favor. In fact, no matter how devastating those
		  absences, we often write as if we didn't care. For both the
		  creators and the users of our new estimators, simply
		  listing the assumptions seems satisfactory, and we treat
		  the ensuing estimates as findings. Statistical estimators
		  have the logical form If A, then B.

		  statistician is constantly advised that many techniques are
		  available, and that choosing the right one requires
		  consulting the quantitatively sophisticated researchers
		  inagivenfield. So Aiken's solution to the trouble is
		  microfoundations, or formal model[s] of the behavior of
		  political actors under study. The model might emerge from
		  decision theory, game theory, or some other formalism. Then
		  the statistical setup is derived mathematically from the
		  model, with no further adhocadjustments. p.439: The formal
		  model justifying a particular application of scobit or
		  power logit has to be plausible, of course, if the
		  microfoundation strategy is to be successful. The examples
		  of informal models just discussed are all questionable, and
		  they seem to show that model-based justifications for

		  If Glockenspiel fits a little better than regression, we
		  have traditionally told ourselves, then it is a better
		  answer than regression or probit. But as we have all
		  learned by our own painful experience, good statistical
		  fitness is not enough. That training regimen too often
		  drives out thinking. p.442: In that context of
		  high-dimensional problems with too little theoretical
		  structure, how can careless curve-fitting and unreliable
		  findings be avoided? The usual answer is that, in research
		  problems without microfoundations, we need hard work,
		  insight, and art to see patterns and establish credible
		  empirical regularities. We think of ourselves as following
		  that advice. But our conventional procedures have let us
		  down, and we have had little success. None of the important
		  empirical generalizations in the discipline has emerged
		  from high-powered methodological research. Instead, almost
		  without exception, they were found with graphs and
		  cross-tabulations. Methodological advances, from multiple
		  regression onward, have largely beenirrelevant. p. 443: The
		  key point is that no one can know whether regressions and
		  MLEs actually fit the data when there are more than two or
		  three independent variables. These high-dimensional
		  explanatory spaces will wrap themselves around any dataset,
		  typically by distortingwhatisgoingon.... Getting rid of

@article{barfrahil03,
	Abstract = {The precarious state of the educational system in the
		  inner cities of the United States, as well as its potential
		  causes and solutions, have been popular topics of debate in
		  recent years. Part of the difficulty in resolving this
		  debate is the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding
		  the true impact of educational initiatives. The efficacy of
		  so-called "school choice" programs has been a particularly
		  contentious issue. A current multimillion dollar program,
		  the School Choice Scholarship Foundation Program in New
		  York, randomized the distribution of vouchers in an attempt
		  to shed some light on this issue. This is an important time
		  for school choice, because on June 27, 2002 the U.S.
		  Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a voucher
		  program in Cleveland that provides scholarships both to
		  secular and religious private schools. Although this study
		  benefits immensely from a randomized design, it suffers
		  from complications common to such research with human
		  subjects: noncompliance with assigned "treatments" and
		  missing data. Recent work has revealed threats to valid
		  estimates of experimental effects that exist in the
		  presence of noncompliance and missing data, even when the
		  goal is to estimate simple intention-to-treat effects. Our
		  goal was to create a better solution when faced with both
		  noncompliance and missing data. This article presents a
		  model that accommodates these complications that is based
		  on the general framework of "principal stratification" and
		  thus relies on more plausible assumptions than standard
		  methodology. Our analyses revealed positive effects on math
		  scores for children who applied to the program from certain
		  types of schools-those with average test scores below the
		  citywide median. Among these children, the effects are
		  stronger for children who applied in the first grade and
		  for African-American children. },

	Annote = {we propose a new variance estimator for OLS as well as for
		  nonlinear estimators such as logit, probit and GMM. This
		  variance estimator enables cluster-robust inference when
		  there is two-way or multi-way clustering that is
		  non-nested. The variance estimator extends the standard
		  cluster-robust variance estimator or sandwich estimator for
		  one-way clustering (e.g. Liang and Zeger (1986), Arellano
		  (1987)) and relies on similar relatively weak
		  distributional assumptions. Our method is easily
		  implemented in statistical packages, such as Stata and SAS,
		  that already offer cluster-robust standard errors when
		  there is one-way clustering. The method is demonstrated by
		  a Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way random effects model;
		  a Monte Carlo analysis of a placebo law that extends the
		  state-year effects example of Bertrand et al. (2004) to two
		  dimensions; and by application to two studies in the
		  empirical public/labor literature where two-way clustering
		  is present.},

	Abstract = {We correct, update, and elaborate Curtin, Presser, and
		  Singer's (2000) report that the University of Michigan's
		  Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA) experienced only a small
		  response rate decline between 1979 and 1996, contrary to
		  the widespread perception of plunging response rates. Our
		  aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate
		  data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000)
		  result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after
		  1996, when caller identification technology became
		  widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the
		  various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results
		  show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was
		  larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer
		  (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper
		  from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to
		  2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and
		  noncontacts.},

@article{follmann19941,
	Abstract = {Subjects in clinical trials are frequently randomized
		  within blocks to ensure balance between treatment groups
		  during the accrual period. Often, the block sizes
		  themselves are also randomly selected. If the trial is
		  unblinded and the block size known, the treatment
		  assignment of some subjects will be known before they are
		  randomized. This knowledge could lead to a bias where the
		  investigator selects healthier subjects for a particular
		  treatment. An investigator's potential to bias study
		  depends on two factors: knowledge of the block distribution
		  and the extent to which he uses this knowledge. Both
		  factors are investigated. Knowledge of the block
		  distribution is reflected by the variability of the
		  estimates of the distribution. Maximum likelihood estimates
		  (MLE) and ad hoc estimates are considered. An
		  investigator's willingness to bias is formalized by
		  defining a class of schemes where the decision to bias
		  depends on the probability of correctly guessing a
		  treatment assignment. The amount of bias these different
		  schemes can introduce is quantified. Fixed blocks are
		  easier to estimate and more susceptible to bias than random
		  blocks. In general, the block distribution with least bias
		  depends on the investigator's biasing strategy. However,
		  block distributions with larger block sizes and uniform or
		  increasing weights should work well in most situations. },

		  educational research in two ways. First, we quantify how
		  much bias there must be in an estimate to invalidate an
		  inference. Second, we utilize Rubin's causal model to
		  interpret the bias necessary to invalidate an inference in
		  terms of sample replacement. We apply our analysis to an
		  inference of a positive effect of Open Court Curriculum on
		  reading achievement from a randomized experiment, and an
		  inference of a negative effect of kindergarten retention on
		  reading achievement from an observational study. We
		  consider details of our framework, and then discuss how our
		  approach informs judgment of inference relative to study
		  design. We conclude with implications for scientific

		  voter rolls in New Haven, CT. That is, this article
		  includes a random sample, randomly assigned to treatment.
		  Thus, causal inferences can be drawn from this study, and
		  extrapolated to the larger population of registered voters
		  in New Haven. In their conclusions, the authors compare
		  their study to studies of other localities, without
		  reference to differences or similarities across towns. It
		  seems that the implied conclusion of the article is that
		  the findings are applicable to all registered voters in the
		  \emph{entire} United States. Since the original sample
		  frame includes only voters in New Haven, a non-randomly
		  selected town, the article's broadest implications appear
		  to be over-reaching. The authors find that canvassing
		  strongly increases turnout, mail weakly increases turnout,
		  and phone calls do not affect turnout. Methodologically,
		  the authors divide the treatment-minus-control effect
		  estimate by the contact [compliance] rate to estimate
		  causal effect. Two-stage OLS and two-stage probit estimates
		  are employed, using assignment to contact as an
		  instrument.},

Gormley describes political scientists as active in primarily non-experimental settings; my remarks below offer some of the contributions of political scientists to policy-experimental research, where the question of interest is often that on which policymakers are most focused: "what works?". First, political science understands the desire of politicians to tie the hands of future officeholders, and how to use evaluation output to do so in a scientifically rigorous way. Political scientists in field experiments are sensitive to the notion that it may be statisticaly desirable to exclude some units from consideration; specifically, those units that are not available to randomize because they are either certainly going to be treated in a policy experiment, or certainly not going to be treated. The concommitant description of a variety of statistical estimands has also been explored by political scientists. Relatedly, units may be lost during an experiment due to unknown factors which are discovered only after a policy experiment is underway, or due to intervening politics. Political scientists have described ex ante solutions to these dangers. Political scientists have translated these solutions into practical advice for experimenters, such as ``randomize at the level one below that at which politicians care". Political scientists also ofer knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of federalism's special challenges. Finally, political psychologists can offer advice on effective political communication derived from laboratory and field experiments.},

	Abstract = {Quite often, policy changes that are seen as
		  welfare-improving at the national level encounter
		  significant resistance in localities where the policies are
		  implemented. Defense spending cuts and international trade
		  agreements are classic examples. However, there is little
		  systematic evidence on the magnitude of economic costs that
		  fall on adversely affected communities. In this paper, we
		  use a newly constructed dataset to analyze the county-level
		  employment and personal income effects resulting from
		  closures of military bases during 1971 - 1994. Our
		  estimated multipliers are mostly less than one, and
		  considerably smaller than those typically used in economic
		  impact studies. We find that the employment costs are
		  mostly limited to the direct job loss associated with
		  military transfers out of the region, and per-capita income
		  is little affected by closures on average.},

He argues that those who have acquired distinctive value-added skills will seek policies to protect them; conversely, those protections will lead individuals and firms to make the investments to create those capacities. Workers with more general skills demand and win fewer protections, which again creates a self-perpetuating logic: The absence of the protection for investment in skills results in lower levels of skill investment. Using individual preferences as his primary unit of analysis, Iversen creates exciting new ways to link choices about skills to a larger dynamic of welfare and party politics, intended to account for national variation in skills and social protection of skills."

	Abstract = {Background and Purpose. One of the roles of rehabilitation
		  professionals in the acute care setting is making
		  recommendations for patients' discharge placement. The
		  purpose of this investigation was to explore the
		  decision-making process of physical therapists and
		  occupational therapists when recommending discharge
		  destination for patients following acute care
		  hospitalization. Subjects. Participants were 7 physical
		  therapists and 2 occupational therapists in an acute care
		  rotation at a large academic medical center. Methods. A
		  grounded-theory strategy was used. Three interviews were
		  conducted and guided by questions about participants'
		  approaches to discharge decision making. Information from
		  the interview transcripts was used to define constructs. A
		  model was generated to explain the relationships among the
		  constructs. Results. Decision making regarding discharge
		  recommendations was guided by 4 constructs: patients'
		  functioning and disability, patients' wants and needs,
		  patients' ability to participate in care, and patients'
		  life context. Information was filtered through therapists'
		  experiences and modified by the health care team's opinions
		  and by health care regulations. Discussion and Conclusion.
		  The decision making of the rehabilitation professionals
		  studied in recommending discharge placements for their
		  patients reflects consideration of patients as individuals
		  and the environments in which they live. Information about
		  patients is filtered through the experience of therapists
		  and influenced by health care regulations and opinions of
		  other health care professionals, the patients, and their
		  associates. The findings might be used in teaching clinical
		  decision making to clinicians and students as they learn to
		  make discharge recommendations. },

	Abstract = {We have independently analyzed the effects of the G.I.
		  Bill's widely-utilized education and training benefits, and
		  reached different conclusions. One of us argues that the
		  implementation of these benefits, especially in the South,
		  helped widen the income and wealth gaps between whites and
		  blacks and further marginalized many African Americans; the
		  other considers them to have been a rare example of a
		  relatively inclusive policy, one that fostered equal
		  citizenship. Because we are both historical
		  institutionalists and we both share interests in matters of
		  social policy, equality, and race, these dissimilar
		  accounts require explanation. This dialogue first considers
		  methodological issues, explaining our decisions about which
		  forms of data to use and to emphasize, and how we made
		  sense of contradictory findings. It next discusses
		  interpretive matters, examining the processes through which
		  we sometimes reached different conclusions even when we
		  confronted the same evidence. Finally, the exchange
		  considers some implications of our findings, probing the
		  lessons they convey both about policy research and
		  practice.},

We illustrate with a design and empirical validation of an evaluation of the Mexican Seguro Popular de Salud (Universal Health Insurance) program we are conducting. Seguro Popular, which is intended to grow to provide medical care, drugs, preventative services, and financial health protection to the 50 million Mexicans without health insurance, is one of the largest health reforms of any country in the last two decades. The evaluation is also large scale, constituting one of the largest policy experiments to date and what may be the largest randomized health policy experiment ever.},

	Abstract = {Political parties have recently rediscovered grassroots
		  tactics for voter mobilization. The only solid evidence for
		  the effectiveness of such get-out-the-vote (GOTV) tactics
		  is based upon non-partisan field experiments that may not
		  accurately capture the effectiveness of partisan campaign
		  outreach. In order to address this lacuna, during the 2002
		  Michigan gubernatorial election, a large field experiment
		  across 14 state house districts evaluated the cost
		  effectiveness of three mobilization technologies utilized
		  by the Michigan Democratic Party's Youth Coordinated
		  Campaign: door hangers, volunteer phone calls, and
		  face-to-face visits. Contrary to past non-partisan
		  experiments, our results indicate that all three GOTV
		  strategies possess similar cost-effectiveness. },

	Abstract = {Deference and dissent strike a delicate balance in any
		  polity. Insufficient deference to authority may
		  incapacitate government, whereas too much may allow leaders
		  to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and
		  cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and
		  willingness to express dissent has long been studied in
		  political science, rarely have scholars studied programs
		  designed to change these aspects of political culture. This
		  study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports a
		  qualitative and quantitative assessment of one such
		  attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind
		  obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and
		  promoting independent thought and collective action in
		  problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio
		  program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was
		  randomly presented to pairs of communities, including
		  communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and
		  imprisoned g{\`E}nocidaires. Changes in individual
		  attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative
		  behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews,
		  focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and
		  unobtrusive measures of collective decision making.
		  Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds
		  of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on
		  listeners' willingness to express dissent and the ways they
		  resolved communal problems.},

		  effect is a robust estimate derived from the randomization
		  distribution of a rank test. This article shows how to
		  carry out a sensitivity analysis for such an estimate in an
		  observational study where treatments are not randomly
		  assigned. Two cases are discussed in detail: matched pairs
		  and the comparison of two unmatched groups. The method uses
		  a model for the distribution of treatment assignments when
		  hidden biases may be present. This model has previously
		  been used for sensitivity analysis of significance levels

	Abstract = {In observational studies of treatment effects, matched
		  samples have$\backslash$ntraditionally been constructed
		  using two tools, namely close matches$\backslash$non one or
		  two key covariates and close matches on the
		  propensity$\backslash$nscore to stochastically balance
		  large numbers of covariates. Here$\backslash$nwe propose a
		  third tool, fine balance, obtained using the
		  assignment$\backslash$nalgorithm in a new way. We use all
		  three tools to construct a matched$\backslash$nsample for
		  an ongoing study of provider specialty in the
		  treatment$\backslash$nof ovarian cancer. Fine balance
		  refers to exact balance of a nominal$\backslash$ncovariate,
		  often one with many categories, but it does not
		  require$\backslash$nindividually matched treated and
		  control subjects for this variable.$\backslash$nIn the
		  example the nominal variable has 72 = 9 x 8 categories
		  formed$\backslash$nfrom 9 possible years of diagnosis and 8
		  geographic locations or$\backslash$nSEER sites. We obtain
		  exact balance on the 72 categories and
		  close$\backslash$nindividual matches on clinical stage,
		  grade, year of diagnosis, and$\backslash$nother variables
		  using a distance, and stochastically balance a
		  total$\backslash$nof 61 covariates using a propensity
		  score. Our approach finds an$\backslash$noptimal match that
		  minimizes a suitable distance subject to the
		  constraint$\backslash$nthat fine balance is achieved. This
		  is done by defining a special$\backslash$npatterned
		  distance matrix and passing it to a subroutine that
		  solves$\backslash$nthe optimal assignment problem, which
		  optimally pairs the rows and$\backslash$ncolumns of a
		  matrix using a polynomial time algorithm. In the
		  example$\backslash$nwe used the function Proc Assign in
		  SAS. A new theorem shows that$\backslash$nwith our
		  patterned distance matrix, the assignment algorithm
		  returns$\backslash$nan optimal, finely balanced matched
		  sample whenever one exists, and$\backslash$notherwise
		  returns an infinite distance, indicating that no such
		  matched$\backslash$nsample exists.},

	Abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not
		  have been observed had the individual been exposed to
		  control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable
		  effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact
		  randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is
		  developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort
		  studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation
		  to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case,
		  considered previously, has certain symmetries that the
		  matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result,
		  approximation for the matched case requires the use of the
		  recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which
		  was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are
		  presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter
		  pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a
		  case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a
		  cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study
		  of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous
		  outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no
		  effect, inference about attributable effects has a
		  different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

		  or increase (to an arbitrarily degree) the bias in causal
		  estimates, depending on the relationship between the
		  distributions of the covariate in the treatment and control
		  groups. Regression without matching ($tau_1$ and $tau_2$
		  here) perform worst. The conclusions are (1) in general
		  both matched sampling and regression adjustment can be
		  expected to reduce bias, (2) in some cases when the
		  variance of the matching variable differs in the two
		  populations both matching and regression adjustment can
		  increase bias, (3) when the variance of the matching
		  variable is the same in the two populations and the
		  distributions of the matching variable are symmetric the
		  usual covariance adjusted estimate based on random samples
		  is almost unbiased, and (4) the combination of regression
		  adjustment in matched samples generally produces the least
		  biased estimate.},

		  States are not randomly assigned to independent variable
		  levels, and they might comprise the entire population of
		  units. If the population of interest is all subnational
		  units in all federal countries, then the American states
		  represent a non-random sample of those units. In their
		  concluding remarks, the authors tend to stick to
		  descriptive, associative language such as ``was unrelated
		  to'', but also use more ambiguous language such as ``[the
		  dependent variable] is a function of [the statistically
		  significant independent variables]''. From the larger
		  context of the article, it is clear that causal claims are
		  being made. This is inappropriate from the standpoint of
		  Display 1.5. This article concludes that more conservative
		  states, and states with higher proportions of Latino and
		  African-American welfare recipients were more likely to
		  adopt strict sanctions and eligibility criteria for welfare
		  receipt after the 1996 PRWORA welfare reform law passed.},

	Abstract = {The effect of unreliability of measurement on propensity
		  score (PS) adjusted treatment effects has not been
		  previously studied. The authors report on a study
		  simulating different degrees of unreliability in the
		  multiple covariates that were used to estimate the PS. The
		  simulation uses the same data as two prior studies.
		  Shadish, Clark, and Steiner showed that a PS formed from
		  many covariates demonstrably reduced selection bias, while
		  Steiner, Cook, Shadish, and Clark identified the subsets of
		  covariates from the larger set that were most effective for
		  bias reduction. Adding different degrees of random error to
		  these covariates in a simulation, the authors demonstrate
		  that unreliability of measurement can degrade the ability
		  of PSs to reduce bias. Specifically, increases in
		  reliability only promote bias reduction, if the covariates
		  are effective in reducing bias to begin with. Increasing or
		  decreasing the reliability of covariates that do not
		  effectively reduce selection bias makes no difference at
		  all.},

		  long distances between villiages assigned to different

Wood concludes in part that states appear to adjust Clean Air Act policy and regulation in response to local interest groups while the federal EPA is not influenced substantially by interest groups. (Wood 92, at 60). However, Wood focuses on a dynamic federal scheme in which simultaneous and overlapping authority is enjoyed by both national and subnational units. Moreover, Wood's empirical conclusions do not reflect on whether national policymaking might be preferable even if interest group influence were roughly equivalent at the state and national levels. In practice, we might just want to cite Wood as some empirical support for the claim that national is less distorted than subnational.},

	Abstract = {Consider a clinical trial to compare two treatments where
		  response is dichotomous and patients enter the trial
		  sequentially. This paper investigates the conduct of such a
		  trial where the "Play the Winner Rule" (PWR) is used to
		  assign patients to the different therapies. The
		  implementation of the PWR in a clinical trial tends to
		  place more patients on the better treatment. Both
		  theoretical and numerical investigations show that over a
		  wide range of situations this rule leads to near optimum
		  results when used in a two-stage manner. Furthermore, these
		  results are insensitive to optimum sample size
		  requirements.},
