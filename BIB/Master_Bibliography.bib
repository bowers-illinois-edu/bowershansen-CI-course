		  this article investigates the application of synthetic
		  control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the
		  advantages of these methods and apply them to study the
		  effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control
		  program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate
		  that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell
		  markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic
		  control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual
		  per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26
		  packs lower than what they would have been in the absence
		  of Proposition 99. Given that many policy interventions and
		  events of interest in social sciences take place at an
		  aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and
		  affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential
		  applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative
		  case studies is very large, especially in situations where
		  traditional regression methods are not appropriate. The
		  methods proposed in this article produce informative
		  inference regardless of the number of available comparison
		  units, the number of available time periods, and whether
		  the data are individual (micro) or aggregate (macro).
		  Software to compute the estimators proposed in this article
		  is available at the authors' web-pages.},

		  to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In
		  addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural

  abstract	= { The past two decades have brought revolutionary change to
		  the field of political methodology. Steady gains in
		  theoretical sophistication have combined with explosive
		  increases in computing power to produce a profusion of new
		  estimators for applied political researchers. Attendance at
		  the annual Summer Meeting of the Methodology Section has
		  multiplied many times, and section membership is among the
		  largest in APSA. All these are signs of success. Yet there
		  are warning signs, too. This paper attempts to critically
		  summarize current developments in the young field of
		  political methodology. It focuses on recent generalizations
		  of dichotomous-dependentvariable estimators such as logit
		  and probit, arguing that even our best new work needs a
		  firmer connection to credible models of human behavior and
		  deeper foundations in reliable empirical generalizations.

		  2002 p.434: By now, though, a concern should have arisen in

		  Yes, dozens of estimators are easily created for any
		  situation. Unfortunately, they often fit approximately
		  equally well but give quite different answers.... Purely
		  statistical considerations cannot tell us what to do. Worse
		  yet, generality is not free. These setups with additional
		  parameters often require surprisingly large
		  datasetstobesuccessful.... p.435: It is important to
		  understand that nothing in the previous paragraphs
		  indicates that scobit and power logit have no uses, or that
		  the software used to generate their estimates is
		  misleading. To the contrary, the estimators are genuine
		  advances and the software generally works well on what is a
		  difficult numerical estimation. The point is rather that
		  generalizing logit can be very expensive in statistical
		  precision, a point confirmed by theoretical work on
		  scobit(Taylor1988). p.436: Since each newestimator imposes
		  a certain structure on the data and often uses up
		  additional degrees of freedom to create statistical
		  generality, why should we believe these assumptions in this
		  problem? Typically, no formal model supports the
		  assumptions, and no close data analysis is presented in
		  their favor. In fact, no matter how devastating those
		  absences, we often write as if we didn't care. For both the
		  creators and the users of our new estimators, simply
		  listing the assumptions seems satisfactory, and we treat
		  the ensuing estimates as findings. Statistical estimators
		  have the logical form If A, then B.

		  [I]n good statistics texts, [the] statistician is
		  constantly advised that many techniques are available, and
		  that choosing the right one requires consulting the
		  quantitatively sophisticated researchers inagivenfield. So
		  Aiken's solution to the trouble is microfoundations, or
		  formal model[s] of the behavior of political actors under
		  study. The model might emerge from decision theory, game
		  theory, or some other formalism. Then the statistical setup
		  is derived mathematically from the model, with no further
		  adhocadjustments. p.439: The formal model justifying a
		  particular application of scobit or power logit has to be
		  plausible, of course, if the microfoundation strategy is to
		  be successful. The examples of informal models just
		  discussed are all questionable, and they seem to show that
		  model-based justifications for scobit and power logit occur
		  only occasionally. Funny stuff on p.440. The Glockenspiel

		  fits a little better than regression, we have traditionally
		  told ourselves, then it is a better answer than regression
		  or probit. But as we have all learned by our own painful
		  experience, good statistical fitness is not enough. That
		  training regimen too often drives out thinking. p.442: In
		  that context of high-dimensional problems with too little
		  theoretical structure, how can careless curve-fitting and
		  unreliable findings be avoided? The usual answer is that,
		  in research problems without microfoundations, we need hard
		  work, insight, and art to see patterns and establish
		  credible empirical regularities. We think of ourselves as
		  following that advice. But our conventional procedures have
		  let us down, and we have had little success. None of the
		  important empirical generalizations in the discipline has
		  emerged from high-powered methodological research. Instead,
		  almost without exception, they were found with graphs and
		  cross-tabulations. Methodological advances, from multiple
		  regression onward, have largely beenirrelevant. p. 443: The
		  key point is that no one can know whether regressions and
		  MLEs actually fit the data when there are more than two or
		  three independent variables. These high-dimensional
		  explanatory spaces will wrap themselves around any dataset,
		  typically by distortingwhatisgoingon.... Getting rid of

		  the IV estimates are merely the ratio $\frac{ITT_y}{ITT_D}$

		  treatment assignment (Z), exclusion (any effect of Z on Y
		  must be ``via an effect of D on Y'' -- or, there is no
		  causal effect of treatment Z on outcome Y for always- and
		  never-takers), assignment Z has nonzero average effect on
		  D, monotonicity (assignment increases probability of
		  treatment). There is a substantial bias in IV effect
		  estimates if the size of the principal component, defiers,
		  is large. Shift from [E(e,Z)=0] to [exclusion and

@Article{	  barfrahil03,
  abstract	= {The precarious state of the educational system in the
		  inner cities of the United States, as well as its potential
		  causes and solutions, have been popular topics of debate in
		  recent years. Part of the difficulty in resolving this
		  debate is the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding
		  the true impact of educational initiatives. The efficacy of
		  so-called "school choice" programs has been a particularly
		  contentious issue. A current multimillion dollar program,
		  the School Choice Scholarship Foundation Program in New
		  York, randomized the distribution of vouchers in an attempt
		  to shed some light on this issue. This is an important time
		  for school choice, because on June 27, 2002 the U.S.
		  Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a voucher
		  program in Cleveland that provides scholarships both to
		  secular and religious private schools. Although this study
		  benefits immensely from a randomized design, it suffers
		  from complications common to such research with human
		  subjects: noncompliance with assigned "treatments" and
		  missing data. Recent work has revealed threats to valid
		  estimates of experimental effects that exist in the
		  presence of noncompliance and missing data, even when the
		  goal is to estimate simple intention-to-treat effects. Our
		  goal was to create a better solution when faced with both
		  noncompliance and missing data. This article presents a
		  model that accommodates these complications that is based
		  on the general framework of "principal stratification" and
		  thus relies on more plausible assumptions than standard
		  methodology. Our analyses revealed positive effects on math
		  scores for children who applied to the program from certain
		  types of schools-those with average test scores below the
		  citywide median. Among these children, the effects are
		  stronger for children who applied in the first grade and
		  for African-American children. },

		  non-nested. The variance estimator extends the standard
		  cluster-robust variance estimator or sandwich estimator for
		  one-way clustering (e.g. Liang and Zeger (1986), Arellano
		  (1987)) and relies on similar relatively weak
		  distributional assumptions. Our method is easily
		  implemented in statistical packages, such as Stata and SAS,
		  that already offer cluster-robust standard errors when
		  there is one-way clustering. The method is demonstrated by
		  a Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way random effects model;
		  a Monte Carlo analysis of a placebo law that extends the
		  state-year effects example of Bertrand et al. (2004) to two
		  dimensions; and by application to two studies in the
		  empirical public/labor literature where two-way clustering

  abstract	= {We correct, update, and elaborate Curtin, Presser, and
		  Singer's (2000) report that the University of Michigan's
		  Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA) experienced only a small
		  response rate decline between 1979 and 1996, contrary to
		  the widespread perception of plunging response rates. Our
		  aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate
		  data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000)
		  result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after
		  1996, when caller identification technology became
		  widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the
		  various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results
		  show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was
		  larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer
		  (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper
		  from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to
		  2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and
		  noncontacts.},

@Article{	  follmann19941,
  abstract	= {Subjects in clinical trials are frequently randomized
		  within blocks to ensure balance between treatment groups
		  during the accrual period. Often, the block sizes
		  themselves are also randomly selected. If the trial is
		  unblinded and the block size known, the treatment
		  assignment of some subjects will be known before they are
		  randomized. This knowledge could lead to a bias where the
		  investigator selects healthier subjects for a particular
		  treatment. An investigator's potential to bias study
		  depends on two factors: knowledge of the block distribution
		  and the extent to which he uses this knowledge. Both
		  factors are investigated. Knowledge of the block
		  distribution is reflected by the variability of the
		  estimates of the distribution. Maximum likelihood estimates
		  (MLE) and ad hoc estimates are considered. An
		  investigator's willingness to bias is formalized by
		  defining a class of schemes where the decision to bias
		  depends on the probability of correctly guessing a
		  treatment assignment. The amount of bias these different
		  schemes can introduce is quantified. Fixed blocks are
		  easier to estimate and more susceptible to bias than random
		  blocks. In general, the block distribution with least bias
		  depends on the investigator's biasing strategy. However,
		  block distributions with larger block sizes and uniform or
		  increasing weights should work well in most situations. },

		  much bias there must be in an estimate to invalidate an
		  inference. Second, we utilize Rubin's causal model to
		  interpret the bias necessary to invalidate an inference in
		  terms of sample replacement. We apply our analysis to an
		  inference of a positive effect of Open Court Curriculum on
		  reading achievement from a randomized experiment, and an
		  inference of a negative effect of kindergarten retention on
		  reading achievement from an observational study. We
		  consider details of our framework, and then discuss how our
		  approach informs judgment of inference relative to study
		  design. We conclude with implications for scientific
		  discourse.},

		  includes a random sample, randomly assigned to treatment.
		  Thus, causal inferences can be drawn from this study, and
		  extrapolated to the larger population of registered voters
		  in New Haven. In their conclusions, the authors compare
		  their study to studies of other localities, without
		  reference to differences or similarities across towns. It
		  seems that the implied conclusion of the article is that
		  the findings are applicable to all registered voters in the
		  \emph{entire} United States. Since the original sample
		  frame includes only voters in New Haven, a non-randomly
		  selected town, the article's broadest implications appear
		  to be over-reaching. The authors find that canvassing
		  strongly increases turnout, mail weakly increases turnout,
		  and phone calls do not affect turnout. Methodologically,
		  the authors divide the treatment-minus-control effect
		  estimate by the contact [compliance] rate to estimate
		  causal effect. Two-stage OLS and two-stage probit estimates
		  are employed, using assignment to contact as an
		  instrument.},

  optannote	= {Gormley argues that PS contributes a) understanding of the
		  process of public policymaking (which politicians don't
		  care about), b) knowledge of when policy analysis matters
		  (when interest groups are powerful and looking for
		  information, when legislators' re-election interests are
		  met, etc., and c) knowledge of the importance of frames,
		  policy locus selection, strategy, etc. While I
		  fundamentally agree with Gormley's characterization of the
		  differences between the contributions of political science
		  and those of economics, I argue that Gormley misses several
		  contributions of political science. Gormley describes
		  political scientists as active in primarily
		  non-experimental settings; my remarks below offer some of
		  the contributions of political scientists to
		  policy-experimental research, where the question of
		  interest is often that on which policymakers are most
		  focused: "what works?". First, political science
		  understands the desire of politicians to tie the hands of
		  future officeholders, and how to use evaluation output to
		  do so in a scientifically rigorous way. Political
		  scientists in field experiments are sensitive to the notion
		  that it may be statisticaly desirable to exclude some units
		  from consideration; specifically, those units that are not
		  available to randomize because they are either certainly
		  going to be treated in a policy experiment, or certainly
		  not going to be treated. The concommitant description of a
		  variety of statistical estimands has also been explored by
		  political scientists. Relatedly, units may be lost during
		  an experiment due to unknown factors which are discovered
		  only after a policy experiment is underway, or due to
		  intervening politics. Political scientists have described
		  ex ante solutions to these dangers. Political scientists
		  have translated these solutions into practical advice for
		  experimenters, such as ``randomize at the level one below
		  that at which politicians care". Political scientists also
		  ofer knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of
		  federalism's special challenges. Finally, political
		  psychologists can offer advice on effective political
		  communication derived from laboratory and field
		  experiments.},

@TechReport{	  hookne99,
  abstract	= {Quite often, policy changes that are seen as
		  welfare-improving at the national level encounter
		  significant resistance in localities where the policies are
		  implemented. Defense spending cuts and international trade
		  agreements are classic examples. However, there is little
		  systematic evidence on the magnitude of economic costs that
		  fall on adversely affected communities. In this paper, we
		  use a newly constructed dataset to analyze the county-level
		  employment and personal income effects resulting from
		  closures of military bases during 1971 - 1994. Our
		  estimated multipliers are mostly less than one, and
		  considerably smaller than those typically used in economic
		  impact studies. We find that the employment costs are
		  mostly limited to the direct job loss associated with
		  military transfers out of the region, and per-capita income
		  is little affected by closures on average.},

		  policies to protect them; conversely, those protections
		  will lead individuals and firms to make the investments to
		  create those capacities. Workers with more general skills
		  demand and win fewer protections, which again creates a
		  self-perpetuating logic: The absence of the protection for
		  investment in skills results in lower levels of skill
		  investment. Using individual preferences as his primary
		  unit of analysis, Iversen creates exciting new ways to link
		  choices about skills to a larger dynamic of welfare and
		  party politics, intended to account for national variation

  abstract	= {Background and Purpose. One of the roles of rehabilitation
		  professionals in the acute care setting is making
		  recommendations for patients' discharge placement. The
		  purpose of this investigation was to explore the
		  decision-making process of physical therapists and
		  occupational therapists when recommending discharge
		  destination for patients following acute care
		  hospitalization. Subjects. Participants were 7 physical
		  therapists and 2 occupational therapists in an acute care
		  rotation at a large academic medical center. Methods. A
		  grounded-theory strategy was used. Three interviews were
		  conducted and guided by questions about participants'
		  approaches to discharge decision making. Information from
		  the interview transcripts was used to define constructs. A
		  model was generated to explain the relationships among the
		  constructs. Results. Decision making regarding discharge
		  recommendations was guided by 4 constructs: patients'
		  functioning and disability, patients' wants and needs,
		  patients' ability to participate in care, and patients'
		  life context. Information was filtered through therapists'
		  experiences and modified by the health care team's opinions
		  and by health care regulations. Discussion and Conclusion.
		  The decision making of the rehabilitation professionals
		  studied in recommending discharge placements for their
		  patients reflects consideration of patients as individuals
		  and the environments in which they live. Information about
		  patients is filtered through the experience of therapists
		  and influenced by health care regulations and opinions of
		  other health care professionals, the patients, and their
		  associates. The findings might be used in teaching clinical
		  decision making to clinicians and students as they learn to
		  make discharge recommendations. },

		  Bill's widely-utilized education and training benefits, and
		  reached different conclusions. One of us argues that the
		  implementation of these benefits, especially in the South,
		  helped widen the income and wealth gaps between whites and
		  blacks and further marginalized many African Americans; the
		  other considers them to have been a rare example of a
		  relatively inclusive policy, one that fostered equal
		  citizenship. Because we are both historical
		  institutionalists and we both share interests in matters of
		  social policy, equality, and race, these dissimilar
		  accounts require explanation. This dialogue first considers
		  methodological issues, explaining our decisions about which
		  forms of data to use and to emphasize, and how we made
		  sense of contradictory findings. It next discusses
		  interpretive matters, examining the processes through which
		  we sometimes reached different conclusions even when we
		  confronted the same evidence. Finally, the exchange
		  considers some implications of our findings, probing the
		  lessons they convey both about policy research and
		  practice.},

		  polity. Insufficient deference to authority may
		  incapacitate government, whereas too much may allow leaders
		  to orchestrate mass violence. Although cross-national and
		  cross-temporal variation in deference to authority and
		  willingness to express dissent has long been studied in
		  political science, rarely have scholars studied programs
		  designed to change these aspects of political culture. This
		  study, situated in post-genocide Rwanda, reports a
		  qualitative and quantitative assessment of one such
		  attempt, a radio program aimed at discouraging blind
		  obedience and reliance on direction from authorities and
		  promoting independent thought and collective action in
		  problem solving. Over the course of one year, this radio
		  program or a comparable program dealing with HIV was
		  randomly presented to pairs of communities, including
		  communities of genocide survivors, Twa people, and
		  imprisoned g{\`E}nocidaires. Changes in individual
		  attitudes, perceived community norms, and deliberative
		  behaviors were assessed using closed-ended interviews,
		  focus group discussions, role-play exercises, and
		  unobtrusive measures of collective decision making.
		  Although the radio program had little effect on many kinds
		  of beliefs and attitudes, it had a substantial impact on
		  listeners' willingness to express dissent and the ways they
		  resolved communal problems.},

		  assigned. Two cases are discussed in detail: matched pairs

		  a model for the distribution of treatment assignments when

  abstract	= {In observational studies of treatment effects, matched
		  samples have$\backslash$ntraditionally been constructed
		  using two tools, namely close matches$\backslash$non one or
		  two key covariates and close matches on the
		  propensity$\backslash$nscore to stochastically balance
		  large numbers of covariates. Here$\backslash$nwe propose a
		  third tool, fine balance, obtained using the
		  assignment$\backslash$nalgorithm in a new way. We use all
		  three tools to construct a matched$\backslash$nsample for
		  an ongoing study of provider specialty in the
		  treatment$\backslash$nof ovarian cancer. Fine balance
		  refers to exact balance of a nominal$\backslash$ncovariate,
		  often one with many categories, but it does not
		  require$\backslash$nindividually matched treated and
		  control subjects for this variable.$\backslash$nIn the
		  example the nominal variable has 72 = 9 x 8 categories
		  formed$\backslash$nfrom 9 possible years of diagnosis and 8
		  geographic locations or$\backslash$nSEER sites. We obtain
		  exact balance on the 72 categories and
		  close$\backslash$nindividual matches on clinical stage,
		  grade, year of diagnosis, and$\backslash$nother variables
		  using a distance, and stochastically balance a
		  total$\backslash$nof 61 covariates using a propensity
		  score. Our approach finds an$\backslash$noptimal match that
		  minimizes a suitable distance subject to the
		  constraint$\backslash$nthat fine balance is achieved. This
		  is done by defining a special$\backslash$npatterned
		  distance matrix and passing it to a subroutine that
		  solves$\backslash$nthe optimal assignment problem, which
		  optimally pairs the rows and$\backslash$ncolumns of a
		  matrix using a polynomial time algorithm. In the
		  example$\backslash$nwe used the function Proc Assign in
		  SAS. A new theorem shows that$\backslash$nwith our
		  patterned distance matrix, the assignment algorithm
		  returns$\backslash$nan optimal, finely balanced matched
		  sample whenever one exists, and$\backslash$notherwise
		  returns an infinite distance, indicating that no such
		  matched$\backslash$nsample exists.},

  abstract	= {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not
		  have been observed had the individual been exposed to
		  control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable
		  effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact
		  randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is
		  developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort
		  studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation
		  to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case,
		  considered previously, has certain symmetries that the
		  matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result,
		  approximation for the matched case requires the use of the
		  recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which
		  was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are
		  presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter
		  pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a
		  case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a
		  cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study
		  of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous
		  outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no
		  effect, inference about attributable effects has a
		  different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

		  sufficient to remove bias due to all observed covariates.
		  Applications include: (i) matched sampling on the
		  univariate propensity score, which is a generalization of
		  discriminant matching, (ii) multivariate adjustment by
		  subclassification on the propensity score where the same
		  subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects for all
		  outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii)
		  visual representation of multivariate covariance adjustment
		  by a two-dimensional plot.},

		  estimates, depending on the relationship between the
		  distributions of the covariate in the treatment and control
		  groups. Regression without matching ($tau_1$ and $tau_2$
		  here) perform worst. The conclusions are (1) in general
		  both matched sampling and regression adjustment can be
		  expected to reduce bias, (2) in some cases when the
		  variance of the matching variable differs in the two
		  populations both matching and regression adjustment can
		  increase bias, (3) when the variance of the matching
		  variable is the same in the two populations and the
		  distributions of the matching variable are symmetric the
		  usual covariance adjusted estimate based on random samples
		  is almost unbiased, and (4) the combination of regression
		  adjustment in matched samples generally produces the least
		  biased estimate.},

		  units in all federal countries, then the American states
		  represent a non-random sample of those units. In their
		  concluding remarks, the authors tend to stick to
		  descriptive, associative language such as ``was unrelated

		  dependent variable] is a function of [the statistically
		  significant independent variables]''. From the larger
		  context of the article, it is clear that causal claims are
		  being made. This is inappropriate from the standpoint of
		  Display 1.5. This article concludes that more conservative
		  states, and states with higher proportions of Latino and
		  African-American welfare recipients were more likely to
		  adopt strict sanctions and eligibility criteria for welfare
		  receipt after the 1996 PRWORA welfare reform law passed.},

		  score (PS) adjusted treatment effects has not been
		  previously studied. The authors report on a study
		  simulating different degrees of unreliability in the
		  multiple covariates that were used to estimate the PS. The
		  simulation uses the same data as two prior studies.
		  Shadish, Clark, and Steiner showed that a PS formed from
		  many covariates demonstrably reduced selection bias, while
		  Steiner, Cook, Shadish, and Clark identified the subsets of
		  covariates from the larger set that were most effective for
		  bias reduction. Adding different degrees of random error to
		  these covariates in a simulation, the authors demonstrate
		  that unreliability of measurement can degrade the ability
		  of PSs to reduce bias. Specifically, increases in
		  reliability only promote bias reduction, if the covariates
		  are effective in reducing bias to begin with. Increasing or
		  decreasing the reliability of covariates that do not
		  effectively reduce selection bias makes no difference at
		  all.},

		  effects of clientelist and public policy messages). The
		  conclusions of the article are cast in causal terms.
		  Several clever research design aspects are included, such
		  as focusing on non-competitive districts (so as to assure
		  that gross electoral outcomes are unaffected), the matching
		  of similar districts before treatment assignment, and the
		  long distances between villiages assigned to different
		  treatments (so as to assure no interference between units).
		  The author finds that clientelist messages positively
		  affect vote choice. Public policy messages have a negative
