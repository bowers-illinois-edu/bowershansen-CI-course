		  effect is a robust estimate derived from the randomization
		  distribution of a rank test. This article shows how to
		  carry out a sensitivity analysis for such an estimate in an
		  observational study where treatments are not randomly
		  assigned. Two cases are discussed in detail: matched pairs
		  and the comparison of two unmatched groups. The method uses
		  a model for the distribution of treatment assignments when
		  hidden biases may be present. This model has previously
		  been used for sensitivity analysis of significance levels

	Abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not
		  have been observed had the individual been exposed to
		  control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable
		  effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact
		  randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is
		  developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort
		  studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation
		  to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case,
		  considered previously, has certain symmetries that the
		  matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result,
		  approximation for the matched case requires the use of the
		  recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which
		  was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are
		  presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter
		  pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a
		  case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a
		  cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study
		  of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous
		  outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no
		  effect, inference about attributable effects has a
		  different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},
