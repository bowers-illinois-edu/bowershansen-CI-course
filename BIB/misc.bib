abstract = {Political parties have recently rediscovered grassroots tactics for voter mobilization. The only solid evidence for the effectiveness of such get-out-the-vote (GOTV) tactics is based upon non-partisan field experiments that may not accurately capture the effectiveness of partisan campaign outreach. In order to address this lacuna, during the 2002 Michigan gubernatorial election, a large field experiment across 14 state house districts evaluated the cost effectiveness of three mobilization technologies utilized by the Michigan Democratic Party's Youth Coordinated Campaign: door hangers, volunteer phone calls, and face-to-face visits. Contrary to past non-partisan experiments, our results indicate that all three GOTV strategies possess similar cost-effectiveness.

	Abstract = {We correct, update, and elaborate Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000) report that the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA) experienced only a small response rate decline between 1979 and 1996, contrary to the widespread perception of plunging response rates. Our aims are to (1) correct errors in the SCA response rate data that affected Curtin, Presser, and Singer's (2000) result, (2) examine the trend in SCA response rates after 1996, when caller identification technology became widespread, and (3) describe the roles played by the various sources of SCA nonresponse over time. The results show that the response rate decline from 1979 to 1996 was larger than described by Curtin, Presser, and Singer (2000); the response rate drop was significantly steeper from 1996 to 2003 than from 1979 to 1996; and the 1979 to 2003 trends differed substantially for refusals and noncontacts.},

@article{Achen:2002,
	Abstract = {  The past two decades have brought revolutionary change to the field of political methodology. Steady gains in theoretical sophistication have combined with explosive increases in computing power to produce a profusion of new estimators for applied political researchers. Attendance at the annual Summer Meeting of the Methodology Section has multiplied many times, and section membership is among the largest in APSA. All these are signs of success. Yet there are warning signs, too. This paper attempts to critically summarize current developments in the young field of political methodology. It focuses on recent generalizations of dichotomous-dependentvariable estimators such as logit and probit, arguing that even our best new work needs a firmer connection to credible models of human behavior and deeper foundations in reliable empirical generalizations. },
	Annote = {Choice quotes:
Achen 2002 p. 424: Even at the most quantitative end of the profession, much contemporary empirical work has little long-termscientificvalue.
Achen 2002 p.434: By now, though, a concern should have arisen in the readers mind. For this generality is all too quick. Yes, dozens of estimators are easily created for any situation. Unfortunately, they often fit approximately equally well but give quite different answers.... Purely statistical considerations cannot tell us what to do. 
Worse yet, generality is not free. These setups with additional parameters often require surprisingly large datasetstobesuccessful....
p.435: It is important to understand that nothing in the previous paragraphs indicates that scobit and power logit have no uses, or that the software used to generate their estimates is misleading. To the contrary, the estimators are genuine advances and the software generally works well on what is a difficult numerical estimation. The point is rather that generalizing logit can be very expensive in statistical precision, a point confirmed by theoretical work on scobit(Taylor1988).
p.436:    Since each newestimator imposes a certain structure on the data and often uses up additional degrees of freedom to create statistical generality, why should we believe these assumptions in this problem? Typically, no formal model supports the assumptions, and no close data analysis is presented in their favor. In fact, no matter how devastating those absences, we often write as if we didn't care. For both the creators and the users of our new estimators, simply listing the assumptions seems satisfactory, and we treat the ensuing estimates as findings.

p.437: [I]n good statistics texts, [the] statistician is constantly advised that many techniques are available, and that choosing the right one requires consulting the quantitatively sophisticated researchers inagivenfield.
So Aiken's solution to the trouble is microfoundations, or formal model[s] of the behavior of political actors under study.     The model might emerge from decision theory, game theory, or some other formalism. Then the statistical setup is derived mathematically from the model, with no further adhocadjustments.
p.439: The formal model justifying a particular application of scobit or power logit has to be plausible, of course, if the microfoundation strategy is to be successful. The examples of informal models just discussed are all questionable, and they seem to show that model-based justifications for scobit and power logit occur only occasionally.
Funny stuff on p.440.  The Glockenspiel rant; and perhaps more relevantly:

But as we have all learned by our own painful experience, good statistical fitness is not enough. That training regimen too often drives out thinking. 
p.442:     In that context of high-dimensional problems with too little theoretical structure, how can careless curve-fitting and unreliable findings be avoided? 
The usual answer is that, in research problems without microfoundations, we need hard work, insight, and art to see patterns and establish credible empirical regularities. We think of ourselves as following that advice. But our conventional procedures have let us down, and we have had little success. None of the important empirical generalizations in the discipline has emerged from high-powered methodological research. Instead, almost without exception, they were found with graphs and cross-tabulations. Methodological advances, from multiple regression onward, have largely beenirrelevant. 
p. 443:    The key point is that no one can know whether regressions and MLEs actually fit the data when there are more than two or three independent variables. These high-dimensional explanatory spaces will wrap themselves around any dataset, typically by distortingwhatisgoingon....
