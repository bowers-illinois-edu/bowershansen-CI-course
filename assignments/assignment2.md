For Tuesday August 7, please submit answers to the following questions:

- (A) From `unit02-Ex.pdf`, questions 1,2, either of 3 & 4 (your choice), and 5a-5b.
- (B) For the Arceneaux (2005), or Acorn, study, estimate (a) the intention to treat effect and (b) the complier average causal effect of the treatment.  For (b),  use (some version of) Bloom's estimator.  ("Some version of" leaves it to you as to whether you'll estimate the intention-to-treat effect using gain scores or not.)  
- (C) Which study's instrument is weakest, the Arceneaux 2005 (Acorn) study, Albertson and Lawrence's (2009) Study 1 (PBS program) or A. & L.'s (2009) Study 2 (Fox News program)? Briefly justify your answer. (In addition to the discussion in lecture, weak instruments are discussed in chapter 5 of _DOS_, among other places.)
