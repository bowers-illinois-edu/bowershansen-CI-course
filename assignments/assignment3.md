Due 14 August 2018.

We challenge you to find an existing study (your own or one from someone else, published or not) and to replicate one of the key analyses in that study using tools learned in this class. For example, you might find a study using a linear model for adjustment (i.e. "controlling for") and you might redo that analysis using matching. And/or you might find a study where you could add or apply permutation-based testing (perhaps you are concerned about the false positive error rate of a study with a weak instrument, a small number of clusters, a skewed outcome, or a small sample size). If you would like to do something other than matching and/or permutation-based testing, let us know.

Data and/or study ideas:

 - You could use your own data if you are replicating one of your own previous studies.
 - You could search the Dataverse <http://dataverse.org/> or the ICPSR Replication Archive <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/deposit/pra/index.jsp> or the 3IE Replication program <http://www.3ieimpact.org/evaluation/impact-evaluation-replication-programme/>
 - Many journals now maintain or point to replication archives.
 - Many scholars now maintain replication archives.
 - You could work on the Medellin data.
