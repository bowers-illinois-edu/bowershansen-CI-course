Hi everyone,

 

A couple of people have approached me with requests for additional readings on causal inference with panel, time-series data.  Keep in mind that Jake's slides from Days 13 - 14 address this topic, with the idea that properly stratified, matched data can be analyzed as a random experiment.  However, IF you still want to incorporate temporal dependence in your project, check out these additional topics:

 

(1) Counterfactual estimators (see also, Jake's slides)

Liu, L., Wang, Y., & Xu, Y. (2021). A practical guide to counterfactual estimators for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.00856.

 

(2) Risk set matching

Li, Y. P., Propert, K. J., & Rosenbaum, P. R. (2001). Balanced risk set matching. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 96(455), 870-882.

(3) Prognostic propensity scores 

Hansen, B. B. (2008). The prognostic analogue of the propensity score. Biometrika, 95(2), 481-488.

 

(4) Difference-in-difference designs with multiple treatment times

(5) General review of matching with observational data
