  \item Today we'll work with a dataset that documents a public policy
    intervention. In 2004 the municipality of Medell\'{i}n, Columbia built
    built the first line of the Metrocable --- a set of cable cars that
    connected poor neighborhoods on the edges of the city to the center of the
    city \citep{cerda2012reducing}. Professor Magdalena Cerd\'{a} and her
    collaborators asked whether this kind of integration could improve life
     in these poor (and heretofore violent) neighborhoods. We have
    some of the data from this project to use here.\footnote{The articles can
      be both found in this web directory
      \url{http://jakebowers.org/Matching/}.} You can load the data here:

<<results='hide'>>=
library(MASS)
library(RItools)
library(optmatch)
meddat <- read.csv("data/meddat.csv",row.names=1)
## Alternatively
load(url("http://jakebowers.org/Matching/meddat.rda"))
@

The data Cerd\'{a} collected tell us about the roughly
\Sexpr{nrow(meddat)} neighborhoods in the study,
\Sexpr{signif(sum(meddat$nhTrt),2)}  of which had access to the Metrocable
line and \Sexpr{signif(sum(1-meddat$nhTrt),2)} did not.


I don't have a formal codebook but here are my guesses about the meanings of
some of the variables. There are more variables in the data file than those
listed here.

\begin{Verbatim}
## The Intervention
nhTrt        Intervention neighborhood (0=no Metrocable station, 1=Metrocable station)

## Some Covariates (there are others, see the paper itself)
nh03         Neighborhood id
nhGroup      Treatment (T) or Control (C)
nhTrt        Treatment (1) or Control (0)
nhHom        Mean homicide rate per 100,000 population in 2003
nhDistCenter Distance to city center (km)
nhLogHom     Log Homicide (i.e. log(nhHom))

## Outcomes (BE03,CE03,PV03,QP03,TP03 are baseline versions)
BE      Neighborhood amenities Score 2008
CE      Collective Efficacy Score 2008
PV      Perceived Violence Score 2008
QP      Trust in local agencies Score 2008
TP      Reliance on police Score 2008
hom     Homicide rate per 100,000 population Score 2008-2003 (in log odds)

HomCount2003 Number of homicides in 2003
Pop2003      Population in 2003
HomCount2008 Number of homicides in 2008
Pop2008      Population in 2008
\end{Verbatim}

Here are a couple of recodes to turn raw homicide counts into homicide rates
per 1000 people.

<<>>=
## These next are equivalent
## meddat$HomRate03<-with(meddat, (HomCount2003/Pop2003)*1000)
## meddat$HomRate08<-with(meddat, (HomCount2008/Pop2008)*1000)
meddat<-transform(meddat, HomRate03=(HomCount2003/Pop2003)*1000)
meddat<-transform(meddat, HomRate08=(HomCount2008/Pop2008)*1000)

So, we have three kinds of variables: an intervention, covariates, and
outcomes.

\item How much evidence do we have to argue against the idea that the Metrocable
intervention had no effect in Medellin?  Make your best matched design to
counter arguments that the intervention-versus-non-intervention comparison is
confounded. Choose an outcome and assess the hypothesis of no effects and
perhaps hypotheses arising from some model of effects.

If you use propensity scores, you may find \texttt{brglm} to work better than
\texttt{glm}.

Here is one approach

<<>>=

## Scalar distance on baseline outcome
tmp <- meddat$HomRate03
names(tmp) <- rownames(meddat)
absdist <- match_on(tmp, z = meddat$nhTrt)

## Propensity score using "bias-reduced" logistic regression (i.e. another
## form of penalized logistic regression.
## install.packages("brglm",dependencies=TRUE)
library(brglm)
balfmla<-reformulate(c(names(meddat)[c(5:7,9:24)],"HomRate03"),response="nhTrt")
brglm1<-brglm(balfmla,data=meddat,family=binomial)
pScore2<-predict(brglm1)
meddat$pScore2<-pScore2
psDist2<-match_on(nhTrt~pScore2,data=meddat)

## Overlapping propensity score plot
## par(mfrow=c(1,2))
## with(meddat,boxplot(split(pScore2,nhTrt)))
## with(meddat,boxplot(split(pScore,nhTrt)))

## Mahalanobis distance
mahalDist<-match_on(balfmla,data=meddat,method="rank_mahalanobis")

fm3<-fullmatch(psDist2+caliper(psDist2,4)
               +caliper(absdist,2)
               +caliper(mahalDist,40),data=meddat,tol=.00001,min.controls=1)

##fm3<-fullmatch(psDist2,data=meddat,tol=.00001,min.controls=1)

meddat$fm3<-NULL
meddat[names(fm3),"fm3"]<-fm3

xb2<-xBalance(update(balfmla,.~.+pScore2),
	      strata=list(raw=NULL,fm3=~fm3),
	      data=meddat,
	      report=c("std.diffs","z.scores","adj.means",
		       "adj.mean.diffs", "chisquare.test","p.values"))
xb2$overall
xb2$results["HomRate03",,]
xb2$results["pScore2",,]

summary(fm3)

\item If we have extra time, you might try to do this same task --- the task of
adjusting comparisons to remove confounding from the comparison of
intervention to non-intervention neighborhoods --- using a linear model (i.e.
"controlling for"). Can you assess the extent to which your results depend on
extrapolation and functional form?
