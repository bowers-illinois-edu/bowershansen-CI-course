\begin{itemize}
\item The Salk vaccine and its two trials.
\item Long a staple of intro stats courses. Moral: RCTS good, observational studies bad.
\item Indeed, observational studies do have a greater potential to mislead, as the example will show.
\item It's an unusually nice, RCT with double-blinding, a placebo, and informed consent in advance of random assignment.
\item The observational study nicely addressed regional variation in polio rates, but didn't have a remedy for systematic differences in who would participate.

- Study 1's difference of rates estimates its a.c.e., $\bar{y}_T - \bar{y}_C$.
- The two studies' ACEs should be about the same. What is Study 2 estimating?

##  Independence vs selection bias in the two vaccine studies 

In Study 1, randomization secures the independence assumption
$$[Y_{T}, Y_{C}] \perp Z.$$
The advance consent design meant that $Z \equiv D$ (dose), more or less, so:
$$[Y_{T}, Y_{C}] \perp D.$$
Thus $\EE[\bar{y}_{\{i:D=1\}} - \bar{y}_{\{i:D=0\}}] = \bar{y}_{T} - \bar{y}_C.$ 

In 1950s America, openness to vaccination ($O$) correlated with social class ($C$), which in turn correlated with polio susceptibility ($P$).  As $O$ predicts $D$, a $D$-$P$ correlation is induced. As a result, in Study 2 
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \not\perp D.$$
The $D$-$S$ correlation would exist within schools ($S$), also preventing _conditional independence_:
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \not\perp D \mid S.$$
So in Study 2, $\EE[\bar{y}_{\{i:D=1\}} - \bar{y}_{\{i:D=0\}}] \neq \bar{y}_{T} - \bar{y}_C$.

## Statistical morality tale 2: 1980 GOTV experiment

Adams & Smith's (1980) telephone GOTV experiment & analysis were marred by their use of per-protocol analysis.

      \begin{tabular}{r@{\hspace{.5em}}rr} \hline
%  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Status} & $n$ \\

$Y$= voted, $D$ = contacted, $Z$ not shown. Adams & Smith reported $\bar{y}_{\{i:D=1\}} - \bar{y}_{\{i:D=0\}}$, or $0.326 - 0.234 = +9$\% -- a "per protocol" analysis.  Unfortunately, a closer look at the data doesn't support
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp D.$$

## ITT analysis of the Adams-Smith experiment

      \end{tabular}
\mh{$\hat{\text{ITT}}_{D} = 0.717-0=71.7\%$}

 \mh{$\hat{\text{ITT}}_{Y} = 0.296 - 0.238 = 5.8\%$}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

These estimates eschew the questionable assumption $(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp D$ in favor of
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp Z,$$
which there is every reason to believe.

\note{The Bloom ratio is 8.1\%, a bit less that A \& S's 9\%.}

## A second look at Salk study 2

The per-protocol analysis of the Salk study required that $(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp D$. If we *conceptualize*
$$Z = \begin{cases} 1,& \text{grade 2}\\
0,& \text{grades 1 \& 3} \end{cases}$$
then the conditional independence assumption
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp Z \mid S$$
seems plausible. (A.k.a. CIA; strong ignorability; no unmeasured confounding assumption.) If we believe this, it's a small additional leap to imagine the study as a stratified r.c.t..


## Exercises

When $\PP(Z=1|S=s)$ is the same for all $s$, the CIA $(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp Z \mid S$ entails the independence^[In general neither this independence assumption nor the C.I.A. entails the other.]
$$(Y_{T}, Y_{C}) \perp Z,$$
which we'll ask you to provisionally assume for the following exercises.

"Vaccinated" and "Grade 2 not innoculated" are 2nd graders; "Controls," 1st and 3rd graders. Columns are \# subjects, \# polio cases, polio rates.
  \begin{columns}

      \item Were there/could there have been ``always-takers''?  
      \item Use Bloom's method to estimate the CACE.  How does your answer compare to the
        RCT's estimate of the ACE, $(41 -81) = -40$ cases per 100K
        innoculations?
      \end{enumerate}
